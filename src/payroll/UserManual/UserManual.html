<h2>About This Software Package</h2>

This “Payroll” software package has been designed and developed with simplicity and ease of usability in mind. It is typically aimed at the SME and the self employed whom, in the majority of cases will not possess the accounting or payroll skills to ensure compliance with current legislation. After completing the installation and company set up procedures on the system which also involves setting “Username and Passwords”. With the above points in mind, once the employee’s have been set up on the system, the system will accept timesheet entries for each employee directly on the screen and from there will calculate the weekly wages for each employee, printing off a payslip for each employee while at the same time generating a weekly report outlining the total weekly cost of the payroll to the employer for the current week, this report may be printed out or viewed from the reports page. At the end of each month a “Form P30” report can be generated and used to complete the revenue’s “Form P30” issued by the revenue. At the end of each year a “Form P35” can be generated and again used to complete the revenue’s “Form P35” also issued by the revenue. “Form P45” available from revenue and “P60” available as a template from the revenue website as a download can also be generated when required.
